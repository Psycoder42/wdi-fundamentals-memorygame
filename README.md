# wdi-fundamentals-memorygame

## Introduction
This is a small project meant to teach various aspects of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It is a single page JavaScript game that has the user try to find two cards of the same rank (e.g. Queen). Although it is called a memory game, memory has very little to do with it in it current form (as it is effectively just a luck based game for now).

## How To Play
Open the page in a modern browser to start the game. To play the game, click on two cards to reveal them. If the cards are the same rank (e.g. Queen) then you win. At the end of each game your statistics will be displayed.
